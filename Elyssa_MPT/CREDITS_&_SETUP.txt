As for the MPT, you must credit me, as follows:

SETUP

That's pretty easy, just copy/paste the 'Elyssa_MPT' folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder! 
In case you don't have a MPT folder, you can just drop the folder in the mod_assets and 
change the 'base_path' variable in the elyssa_layeredimage.rpy file so that it's just:
base_path = "mod_assets/Elyssa_MPT/".

You can either use the Exposer Previewer feature to easily preview Elyssa and customize her sprite,
or use her layeredimage with the attributes in it. I'll perhaps release a cheat sheet of her sprite in 
the near future.

Note: Some attributes in the Exposer previewer will display nothing, for example the 'rup' attribute for
her right arm on her uniform outfit. That's just because every single attribute is in the same group left,
so it doesn't care about which outfit has which attributes (Elyssa doesn't have an 'rup' attribute for her uniform).

If you have any questions or issues with the pack, don't hesitate to contact me on my Discord mentioned above!

Enjoy the pack! :D
