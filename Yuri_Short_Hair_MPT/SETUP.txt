To get this MPT to work, simply put the 'Yuri_Short_Hair_MPT' folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder
of your mod! I'd also recommend reading its content, a lot of information can be found there.
Also, the Cheat Sheet is here to help you with her poses and expressions!

Don't forget to see the Credits_assets.txt file to properly credit each person that made
that MPT possible, including myself, iiTzWolfyy :)
