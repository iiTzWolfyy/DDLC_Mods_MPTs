Make sure to credit:

- Etched for making the original Sayori bikini sprite!
- Me, iitzwolfyy_ on Discord or iiTzWolfyy on Reddit, but preferably Discord)

SETUP - Please make sure to contact me if you have any troubles with anything, using my contacts above :)

I'll assume you already have the Sayori's MPT in your project, as well as a 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.
Another important thing, the syntax for this sprite is the same than the original MPT, except for the attributes
'swimsuit', 'mouth1' and 'mouth2'.

Nothing special about the setup, just copy/paste the 'sayori_swimsuit_MPT' folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.

If everything is okay, try using the following in your story:
show sayori turned swimsuit happ at t11

If Sayori shows up in her swimsuit with a happy mood, then that's perfect!

Note: there are 2 extra mouths associated with Sayori's turned expression, which are called 'mouth1' and 'mouth2'.
You can use both of them by writing those attributes down, for example like below:
show sayori turned swimsuit happ mouth1 (or mouth2) at t11

Enjoy now! :D
