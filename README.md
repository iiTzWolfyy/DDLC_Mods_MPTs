This repository is meant to store all character MPTs I created for the DDMC (Doki Doki Modding Community).  
It assumes the user is already familiar with the `layeredimage` feature of `Ren'Py`.

### These tools are only meant to be used by anyone who wanna create a DDLC mod and aren't meant to be used in any other type of project. Please check their [IP Guidelines](https://teamsalvato.com/ip-guidelines) if you haven't already.

If you wanna contact me or if you have any questions, feel free to do so using my *Discord* username: `iitzwolfyy_` or my *Reddit*, `u/iiTzWolfyy`!

## MPT - What is it?

MPT (Mood Posing Tool) is a tool based on the `layeredimage` feature that's been added since the *Ren'Py 7* version.
It allows the user to write a character pose and expression in an easier, faster, and more intuitive way, despite the syntax being longer.

For example the line:

`show sayori turned happ rup ldown om ce`  

means that Sayori has the `happy` mood, her right arm is up (`rup`), her left arm is down (`ldown`), her mouth is opened (`om`) and her eyes are closed (`ce`).

Of course, a lot of other options are available to easily customize the character pose and expression.  
For that, the user can always check the character's `layeredimage.rpy` file provided in their `zip` archive.

## MPT - What characters are available?

**It contains, as of now (sorted by date, from oldest to newest):**
1. **Yuri Short Hair** (most popular) with uniform and casual outfits (Cheat Sheet available for more help).
2. **Skinny/Slim MC** in uniform.

11. **Elyssa** with uniform, casual, green vest (worn and on her waistline), laboratory and white shirt outfits.
12. **Messy Black Hair MC** with uniform and black hoodie outfits (only a rehost, it hasn't been made by me).
13. **Satsurika** (mix of the 4 original dokis with bright pink hair, **don't ask me why this exists nor why I made it**) with uniform and casual outfits.
14. **Natsuri** (mix of Natsuki and Yuri) with uniform, dark pink sweater, white shirt and green shirt outfits.

### What the modder must do with these MPTs:

- Read the `credits` file that's in every one of them, and give **proper credit in their own project's credits file** as mentioned in said file.

### What the modder can do with these MPTs:

- Freely edit the content of an MPT as they like (adding/editing/removing files or images)

### Please refer to the `Releases` page for the downloads!

To make the MPT usage more easy for you, I'd recommend using `Exposer Previewer`, which allows you to preview the character's pose and expression, and copy/paste it to your story! You can find it [here!](https://github.com/Bronya-Rand/ExPoser-Previewer)

### Enjoy!
