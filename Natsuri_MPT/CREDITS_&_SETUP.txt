If you want to use Natsuri, please credit these people:

	Hoeruko - Character design
	IanSuller_blogger/Ein had a Motive & Ceaser Madrazo - Sprite Set
	Matic - Casual outfit and sprite edits
	iiTzWolfyy (iitzwolfyy_ on Discord) for the entire MPT pack and the code

As always, just copy/paste the Natsuri_MPT folder inside your mod_assets/MPT/ folder!
If you don't have the MPT folder or wanna change the path to the Natsuri_MPT folder,
just change the first variable in natsuri_layeredimage.rpy.
There is a ton of info and explanations in the layeredimage file, so don't hesitate
to take a look at it. 
Also, I recommend using Exposer Previewer to make your expressions quickly and easily.

Don't hesitate to come to me on my Discord mentioned above for any questions or if
you have any troubles.
