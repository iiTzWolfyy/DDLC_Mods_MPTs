Make sure to credit:

- Etched for making the original Natsuki bikini sprite!
- Me iitzwolfyy_ on Discord or iiTzWolfyy on Reddit, but preferably Discord

SETUP - Please make sure to contact me if you have any troubles with anything, using my contacts above :)

Note: Natsuki doesn't have a cross pose for this outfit!

I'll assume you already have the Natsuki's MPT in your project, as well as a 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.
Another important thing, the syntax for this sprite is the same than the original MPT, except for the attributes
'swimsuit', 'eyes1' and 'eyes2'.

Nothing special about the setup, just copy/paste the 'natsuki_swimsuit_MPT' folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.

If everything is okay, try using the following in your story:
show natsuki turned swimsuit lpoint rhip happ at t11

If Natsuki shows up in her swimsuit with a happy mood, her left hand pointing up and her right hand on
her hip, then that's perfect!

Note: there are 2 extra eyes associated with Natsuki's turned expression, which are called 'eyes1' and 'eyes2'.
You can use both of them by writing those attributes down, for example like below:
show natsuki turned swimsuit happ eyes1 (or eyes2) at t11

Enjoy now! :D
