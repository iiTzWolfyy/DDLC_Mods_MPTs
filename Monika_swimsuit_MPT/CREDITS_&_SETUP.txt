CREDITS

Make sure to credit:

- Etched for making the original Monika bikini sprite!
- Me (as 'iitzwolfyytherenewal' on Discord or 'iiTzWolfyy' on Reddit, but preferably Discord)

There was supposed to be another one, but their account seem to be deleted on Reddit, even though they did
many remakes of this sprite here...

SETUP - Please make sure to contact me if you have any troubles with anything, using my contacts above :)

Alright, onto the setup! Nothing really special, though you must be aware: this MPT uses the original Monika's MPT
as well, but I guess since you're here, you probably have it already.

Since I originally intended to do this MPT for the needs of a friend of mine, I edited directly his own
monika_layeredimage.rpy file since that was the easiest solution. And you're basically gonna do the same as me!

Don't worry, nothing too hard.

1/ See that monika_layeredimage.rpy file in the folder? Open it, that's basically the original Monika's MPT to which
I added the necessary things for the swimsuit outfit. Also open your own copy of the file next to it, you'll need it.

You'll perhaps have different things in your own MPT depending on what outfits you may have added and all but that
doesn't matter (or if you already have another swimsuit outfit for her in that file, you can basically change the
'swimsuit' name I used in my rpy file with something else when you'll copy the necessary lines
(be sure to change every occurrence of 'swimsuit'!).

2/ See this 'path' variable? That's the default path of the 'monika_swimsuit' assets folder you have, that way you can
change it easily (as I already wrote)

3/ Now you'll see that in the file, I've written '###ADD' above multiple attributes. That's the attributes you'll
have to add in the same place in your own monika_layeredimage.rpy file! I couldn't think of anything easier to do for ya!
Only exception being the last layeredimage, you can completely copy/paste that one at the end of your file!

TO BE MORE PRECISE!
I also had to change the 'layeredimage monika forward' a little to make it work with the outfit, but nothing crazy dw.
See that 'always "mod_assets/MPT/monika/monika_forward_facebase.png"' in the beginning of that layeredimage?
Remove it and instead, add the group 'head' I wrote after the 'group right' :)
If you've already had to remove it and put a 'group head' or something like that for your own purposes, then you can
simply add the attribute related to the swimsuit outfit :)

Last thing, you can (of course!) change the attributes names if you aren't feeling okay with it, for example if you don't
like 'show monika lean swimsuit_cheek...' and want 'show monika lean swimsuit_handup...', simply go into the
'monika lean' layeredimage and change the 'swimsuit_cheek' attribute with 'swimsuit_handup'!

Anyway, I know this might've been waaaaaaay too long to read, but I just want to make sure you aren't messing things
up with your files :Ehehe:

Enjoy now! :D
