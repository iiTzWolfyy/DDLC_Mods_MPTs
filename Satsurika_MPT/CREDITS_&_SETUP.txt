Credits using the following lines:
    - AjTheFunky & Ein Had A Motive for the original Satsurika sprite
    - iiTzWolfyy (iitzwolfyy_ on Discord) for the MPT-compatible version of Satsurika!

To use the MPT, just put the "Satsurika_MPT" folder into your "mod_assets/MPT/"
folder! If you want to change the location of that MPT in your project, let's say
you want to put it into your "mod_assets/sprites/" folder, you'll just have to change
the 'path' variable in the layeredimage file accordingly!

Satsurika can blink, but it's disabled by default. To enable it, check the group blink
in her layeredimage file. Last thing, no need for a 'turned' or 'forward' keyword, as
she only has one layeredimage defined.

As always, if you have any issues or questions regarding the MPT, please contact me on 
my Discord mentioned above!
