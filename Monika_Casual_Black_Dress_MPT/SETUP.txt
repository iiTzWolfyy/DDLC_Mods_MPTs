Okay, first thanks for downloading this Monika MPT-compatible outfit! 
Here are the (simple!!!) steps to install it properly, since you'll simply have to
edit the original monika_layeredimage.rpy file.
NOTE: IF YOU INSTALLED monika_casual_dress PACK AS WELL (the one I released in the DDMC server before this one),
THEN YOU ONLY NEED TO DO THE STEPS FOR THE BODY AND HEAD PARTS (only steps 2/, 3/, 4/, 5/, 6/, 7/, 9/ and 10/ !!)

1/ CUT AND PASTE (or drag and drop) both 'monika_lean_eyes_e7.png' and 'monika_lean_mouth_m5.png' images
in 'mod_assets/MPT/monika' folder, so that they're both with all the other images of Monika.
Also, put the 'monika_casual_black_dress' folder in your game folder (best would be mod_assets and/or MPT).

NOTE: this implies that you have a 'mod_assets' folder and the 'MPT' folder into the 'mod_assets' one.
You obviously can't use that pack if you didn't download the MPT beforehand!

2/ Open monika_layeredimage.rpy in the MPT folder, and take a look at the 'layeredimage monika forward:'

3/ In the 'group outfit', add 'attribute black_dress null' or any other name that you'd like instead of 'black_dress'.
	That's the new outfit we are defining.

Note that if you decide to replace 'black_dress' with another name, make sure to also replace every occurrence
of 'black_dress' in the following steps.

4/In the 'group left', add, right under the last 'ldown' attribute: 

	'attribute ldown default if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/1l.png"

	Now for 'lpoint':

	attribute lpoint if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/2l.png"

5/Same as 4/ but for the group right this time (rdown and rhip respectively):

	attribute rdown default if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/1r.png"

	attribute rhip if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/2r.png"

6/ Now go to the 'layeredimage monika lean' that is under the 'layeredimage monika forward'

7/ Do the step 3/ again for this one

8/ In the 'group mood', add 2 attributes: attribute vhapp null
        				  attribute surp null

9/ In the 'group body', add this: 

	attribute body default if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/monika_lean_casual_body.png"

10/ In the 'group head', add this:

	attribute head default if_any(["black_dress"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika_casual_black_dress/monika_lean_casual_facebase.png"

11/ In the 'group mouth', for the first 'attribute cm default if_any(["happ"]):', change it to this:
	
	attribute cm default if_any(["happ", "vhapp"]):

	We're basically and simply adding the moods we defined in the 'group mood' so that the face will update 
	accordingly.

	Same for the second 'attribute cm':

 		attribute cm default if_any(["neut","angr","anno", "surp"]):


	Now for the 'attribute om if_any(["happ"]), replace with:
		attribute om if_any(["happ", "vhapp"]):

	and add this new attribute under the 'om' ones:
		
	attribute om if_any(["surp"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika/monika_lean_mouth_m5.png"

	This uses the new mouth that was in the folder.

	You can add the truncated tag of that new mouth by defining it under 'attribute m4':

	attribute m5:
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika/monika_lean_mouth_m5.png"


	WE'RE ALMOST DONE DON'T WORRY ABOUT IT!! :)

12/ In the 'group eyes', replace 'attribute ce if_any(["neut","angr","anno"])' with:
	
	attribute ce if_any(["neut","angr","anno", "surp"]):

	Now, define a new attribute that will use the eyes image that was in the folder as well:

	attribute ce if_any(["vhapp"]):
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika/monika_lean_eyes_e7.png"

	For the truncated tag, add under the 'attribute e6':
		
	attribute e7:
            "mod_assets/MPT/monika/monika_lean_eyes_e7.png"

LAST STEP: In the 'group eyebrows', instead of 'attribute brow default if_any(["happ","neut"]):', replace with:

	attribute brow default if_any(["happ","neut", "vhapp", "surp"]):

And...done! You have your beautiful black dress for your dear Monika :)
