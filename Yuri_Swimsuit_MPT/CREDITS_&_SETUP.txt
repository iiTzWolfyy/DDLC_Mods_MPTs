CREDITS

Make sure to credit:

- Etched for making the original Yuri bikini sprite!
- Me, iitzwolfyy_ on Discord or iiTzWolfyy on Reddit, but preferably Discord

SETUP - Please make sure to contact me if you have any troubles with anything, using my contacts above :)

I'll assume you already have the Yuri's MPT in your project, as well as a 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.
Another important thing, the syntax for this sprite is the same than the original MPT, except for the attributes
'swimsuit' and 'eyes1'.

Nothing special about the setup, just copy/paste the 'Yuri_Swimsuit_MPT' folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder.

If everything is okay, try using the following in your story:
show yuri turned swimsuit happ at t11

If Yuri shows up in her swimsuit with a happy mood, that's perfect!

Note: there is an extra pair of eyes in the file that you can use with her turned position, 
using the attribute 'eyes1', like below:
show yuri turned swimsuit happ eyes1 at t11

Enjoy now! :D
