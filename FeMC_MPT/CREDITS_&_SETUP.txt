Please credit me and the original artists of the sprite as the following in your credits file:

FeMC MPT pack : iitzwolfyy_ on Discord
Sprite commissioned by : BlackRabbitArtworks
Design of the sprite : MW Roach


Anyway, you'll only need to drop the FeMC_MPT folder into your 'mod_assets/MPT/' folder!

Also, if for some reason you need/want to change the path of that 
same folder, you can change it in the femc_layeredimage.rpy file!

I strongly recommend you to read the layeredimage file since I wrote multiple 
comments in the layeredimage to help you know which attribute corresponds to which type of expression.

If you have any issue, contact me on my Discord mentioned above.

Anyway, enjoy FeMC MPT pack!
