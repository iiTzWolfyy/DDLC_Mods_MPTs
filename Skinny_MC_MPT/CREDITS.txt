Also, it's not necessary, but really appreciated for you to credit me as 'u/iiTzWolfyy' on Reddit
and/or my Discord, iitzwolfyytherenewal, for the edits that made that MPT possible!

I'll also repeat it here, but you can custom the layeredimage by adding/removing/editing things in the file!
If you don't know how the layeredimages work, you can still take a look in the rpy file, I'm explaining
there how it works :)
