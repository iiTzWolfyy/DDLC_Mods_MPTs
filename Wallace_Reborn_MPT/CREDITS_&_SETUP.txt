First thing, if you EVER have any problem regarding this MPT, feel free to add my Discord (mentioned above)
or my Reddit (u/iiTzWolfyy) :)

To install the MPT, it's simple: simply copy/paste the main folder, called 'Wallace_Reborn_MPT' into your
'mod_assets/MPT/' folder. If you take a look at the wallace_layeredimage.rpy file, there is a variable
called 'path' in the beginning. If the default path I've set doesn't suit you, you can just change it,
everything's still going to work!

There also are comments in the file, so that you know which attribute matches which image.

Enjoy Wallace! :D (I didn't enjoy having to do it, trust me...)
